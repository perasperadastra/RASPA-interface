# RASPA-interface
This is a lite RASPA interface
You must have downloaded and in you ~path the following libraries: Matplotlib, RASPA2, Openbabel.
This version have a few problems as the needing to have the input file in the directory where the simulation is going to be performed and in the raspa/share/ directory.
Also the texto.txt file must be always in the same directory as the inpuscript.py file.

I hope you take fun with this code.
